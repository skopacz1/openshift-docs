== About this release

// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:xxxx[RHSA-2024:xxxx]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md[Kubernetes 1.31] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. From the {hybrid-console}, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

// Double check OP system versions
{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 8.8 and a later version of {op-system-base} 8 that is released before End of Life of {product-title} {product-version}. {product-title} {product-version} is also supported on {op-system-first}. To understand {op-system-base} versions used by {op-system}, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6907891[{op-system-base} Versions Utilized by {op-system-first} and {product-title}] (Knowledgebase article).

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base} for compute machines. {op-system-base} machines are deprecated in {product-title} 4.16 and will be removed in a future release.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517

//Even-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for even-numbered releases)
Starting from {product-title} 4.14, the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase for even-numbered releases increases the total available lifecycle to 24 months on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures. Beyond this, Red{nbsp}Hat also offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as _Additional EUS Term 2_, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of {product-title}. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

//Odd-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for odd-numbered releases)
////
The support lifecycle for odd-numbered releases, such as {product-title} {product-version}, on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures is 18 months. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].
////

Commencing with the {product-title} 4.14 release, Red{nbsp}Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red{nbsp}Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

[id="ocp-4-18-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts:

[id="ocp-release-notes-auth_{context}"]
=== Authentication and authorization

[id="ocp-release-notes-auth-ccoctl-rotation_{context}"]
==== Rotating OIDC bound service account signer keys

With this release, you can use the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) utility (`ccoctl`) to rotate the OpenID Connect (OIDC) bound service account signer key for clusters installed on the following cloud providers:

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/changing-cloud-credentials-configuration.adoc#rotating-bound-service-keys_key-rotation-aws[{aws-first} with {sts-first}]
* xref:../post_installation_configuration/changing-cloud-credentials-configuration.adoc#rotating-bound-service-keys_key-rotation-gcp[{gcp-first} with {gcp-wid-short}]
* xref:../post_installation_configuration/changing-cloud-credentials-configuration.adoc#rotating-bound-service-keys_key-rotation-azure[{azure-first} with {entra-short}]

[id="ocp-release-notes-backup-restore_{context}"]
=== Backup and restore

[id="ocp-4-18-hibernating_{context}"]
==== Hibernating a cluster for up to 90 days

With this release, you can now hibernate your {product-title} cluster for up to 90 days and expect the cluster to recover successfully. Before this release, you could only hibernate for up to 30 days.

For more information, see xref:../backup_and_restore/hibernating-cluster.adoc#hibernating-cluster[Hibernating an {product-title} cluster].

[id="ocp-release-notes-builds_{context}"]
=== Builds

[id="ocp-release-notes-cro_{context}"]
=== Cluster Resource Override Admission Operator

[id="ocp-release-notes-extensions_{context}"]
=== Extensions ({olmv1})

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) has been included with {product-title} 4 since its initial release and has helped grow and enable a substantial ecosystem of solutions and advanced workloads running as Operators. {product-title} {product-version} introduces {olmv1}, the next-generation Operator Lifecycle Manager, as a General Availability feature, designed to improve how you manage Operators on {product-title}.

Previously available as a Technology Preview feature only, this updated framework evolves many of the concepts that have been part of previous versions of {olmv0} by simplifying Operator management, enhancing secrutiy, and boosting reliability.

[NOTE]
====
The documentation for {olmv1} exists as a stand-alone guide called xref:../extensions/index.adoc#olmv1-about[Extensions]. Previously, {olmv1} documentation was a subsection of the xref:../operators/index.adoc#operators-overview[Operators] guide, which otherwise documents the {olmv0} feature set.

The updated location and guide name reflect a more focused documentation experience and aims to differentiate between {olmv1} and {olmv0}.
====

Simplified API::
{olmv1} simplifies Operator management with a new, user-friendly API: xref:../extensions/arch/operator-controller.adoc#olmv1-clusterextension-api_operator-controller[the `ClusterExtension` object]. By managing Operators as integral extensions of the cluster, {olmv1} caters to the special lifecycle requirements of custom resource definition (CRDs). This design aligns more closely with Kubernetes principles, treating Operators, which consist of custom controllers and CRDs, as cluster-wide singletons.
+
{product-title} continues to give you access to the latest Operator packages, patches, and updates through default xref:../extensions/catalogs/rh-catalogs.adoc#rh-catalogs[Red Hat Operator catalogs]. With {olmv1}, you can install an Operator package by creating and applying a `ClusterExtension` API object in your cluster. By interacting with `ClusterExtension` objects, you can manage the lifecycle of Operator packages, quickly understand their status, and troubleshoot issues.

Streamlined declarative workflows::
Leveraging the simplified API, you can define your desired Operator states in a declarative way and, when integrating with tools like Git and Zero Touch Provisioning, let {olmv1} automatically maintain those states. This minimizes human error and unlocks a wider range of use cases.

Uninterrupted operations with continuous reconciliation and optional rollbacks::
{olmv1} enhances reliability through continuous reconciliation. Rather than relying on single attempts, {olmv1} proactively addresses Operator installation and update failures, automatically retrying until the issue is resolved. This eliminates the manual steps previously required, such as deleting `InstallPlan` API objects, and greatly simplifies the resolution of off-cluster issues, such as missing container images or catalog problems.
+
In addition, {olmv1} provides optional rollbacks, allowing you to revert Operator version updates under specific conditions after carefully assessing any potential risks.

Granular update control for deployments::
With granular update control, you can select a specific Operator version or define a range of acceptable versions. For example, if you have tested and approved version `1.2.3` of an Operator in a stage environment, instead of hoping the latest version works just as well in production, you can use version pinning. By specifying `1.2.3` as the desired version, you can ensure that is the exact version that will be deployed for a safe and predictable update.
+
Alternatively, automatic z-stream updates provide a seamless and secure experience by automatically applying security fixes without manual intervention, minimizing operational disruptions.

Enhanced security with user-provided `ServiceAccount` objects::
{olmv1} prioritizes security by minimizing its permission requirements and providing greater control over access. By using user-provided `ServiceAccount` objects for Operator lifecycle operations, {olmv1} access is restricted to only the necessary permissions, significantly reducing the control plane attack surface and improving overall security. In this way, {olmv1} adopts a least-privilege model to minimize the impact of a compromise.

[id="ocp-release-notes-edge-computing_{context}"]
=== Edge computing

[id="ocp-4-18-edge-computing-sno-shutdown_{context}"]
==== Shutting down and restarting {sno} clusters up to 1 year after cluster installation

With this release, you can shut down and restart {sno} clusters up to 1 year after cluster installation. If certificates expired while the cluster was shut down, you must approve certificate signing requests (CSRs) upon restarting the cluster.

Before this update, you could shut down and restart {sno} clusters for only 120 days after cluster installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Evacuate all workload pods from the {sno} cluster before you shut it down.
====

For more information, see xref:../backup_and_restore/graceful-cluster-shutdown.adoc#graceful-shutdown-cluster[Shutting down the cluster gracefully].

[id="ocp-4-18-deprecation-of-siteconfig-v1_{context}"]
==== Deprecation of SiteConfig v1

SiteConfig v1 is deprecated starting with {product-title} 4.18. Equivalent and improved functionality is now available through the SiteConfig Operator using the `ClusterInstance` custom resource. For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledge Base solution link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7105238[Procedure to transition from SiteConfig CRs to the ClusterInstance API].

For more information about the SiteConfig Operator, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.12/html-single/multicluster_engine_operator_with_red_hat_advanced_cluster_management/index#siteconfig-intro[SiteConfig].

[id="ocp-release-notes-hcp_{context}"]
=== Hosted control planes

Because {hcp} releases asynchronously from {product-title}, it has its own release notes. For more information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosted-control-planes-release-notes.adoc#hosted-control-planes-release-notes[{hcp-capital} release notes].

[id="ocp-release-notes-ibm-z_{context}"]
=== {ibm-z-title} and {ibm-linuxone-title}

With this release, {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} are now compatible with {product-title} {product-version}. You can perform the installation with z/VM, LPAR, or {op-system-base-full} Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM). For installation instructions, see
xref:../installing/installing_ibm_z/preparing-to-install-on-ibm-z.adoc#preparing-to-install-on-ibm-z[Installation methods].

[id="ocp-4-18-holdover-in-grandmaster-clock_{context}"]
==== Holdover in a grandmaster clock with GNSS as the source

With this release, you can configure the holdover behavior in a grandmaster (T-GM) clock with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) as the source. Holdover allows the T-GM clock to maintain synchronization performance when the GNSS source is unavailable. During this period, the T-GM clock relies on its internal oscillator and holdover parameters to reduce timing disruptions.

You can define the holdover behavior by configuring the following holdover parameters in the `PTPConfig` custom resource (CR):

* `MaxInSpecOffset`
* `LocalHoldoverTimeout`
* `LocalMaxHoldoverOffSet`

For more information, see xref:../networking/ptp/configuring-ptp.adoc#holdover-in-a-grandmaster-clock_configuring-ptp[Holdover in a grandmaster clock with GNSS as the source].

[id="ocp-release-notes-networking-user-defined-network-segmentation_{context}"]
==== User-defined network segmentation (Generally Available)

With {product-title} {product-version}, user-defined network segmentation is generally available. User-defined networks (UDN) introduce enhanced network segmentation capabilities by allowing administrators to define custom network topologies using namespace-scoped UserDefinedNetwork and cluster-scoped ClusterUserDefinedNetwork custom resources.

With UDNs, administrators can create tailored network topologies with enhanced isolation, IP address management for workloads, and advanced networking features. Supporting both Layer 2 and Layer 3 topology types, user-defined network segmentation enables a wide range of network architectures and topologies, enhancing network flexibility, security, and performance. For more information on supported features, see xref:../networking/multiple_networks/understanding-multiple-networks.adoc#support-matrix-for-udn-nad_understanding-multiple-networks[UDN support matrix].

Use cases of UDN include providing virtual machines (VMs) with a lifetime duration for static IP addresses assignment as well as a Layer 2 primary pod network so that users can live migrate VMs between nodes. These features are all fully equipped in {VirtProductName}. Users can use UDNs to create a stronger, native multi-tenant environment, allowing you to secure your overlay Kubernetes network, which is otherwise open by default. For more information, see xref:../networking/multiple_networks/primary_networks/about-user-defined-networks.adoc#about-user-defined-networks[About user-defined networks].

=== Scalability and performance

[id="ocp-release-notes-scalability-and-performance-cluster-compare_{context}"]
==== Cluster validation with the cluster-compare plugin

The `cluster-compare` plugin is an OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin that compares a cluster configuration with a target configuration. The plugin reports configuration differences while suppressing expected variations by using configurable validation rules and templates.

For example, the plugin can highlight unexpected differences, such as mismatched field values, missing resources, or version discrepancies, while ignoring expected differences, such as optional components or hardware-specific fields. This focused comparison makes it easier to assess cluster compliance with the target configuration.

You can use the `cluster-compare` plugin in development, production, and support scenarios.

For more information about the `cluster-compare` plugin, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cluster-compare/understanding-the-cluster-compare-plugin.adoc#cluster-compare-overview_understanding-cluster-compare[Overview of the cluster-compare plugin].

[id="ocp-release-notes-node-tuning-operator-deferred-updates_{context}"]

[id="ocp-release-notes-scalability-and-performance-nrop-policy_{context}"]
==== NUMA Resources Operator now uses default SELinux policy

With this release, the NUMA Resources Operator no longer creates a custom SELinux policy to enable the installation of Operator components on a target node. Instead, the Operator uses a built-in container SELinux policy. This change removes the additional node reboot that was previously required when applying a custom SELinux policy during an installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In clusters with an existing NUMA-aware scheduler configuration, upgrading to {product-title} 4.18 might result in an additional reboot for each configured node. For further information about how to manage an upgrade in this scenario and limit disruption, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase article link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7107603[Managing an upgrade to {product-title} 4.18 or later for a cluster with an existing NUMA-aware scheduler configuration]

[id="ocp-4-18-release-notes-storage-cifs-smb-csi-driver_{context}"]
==== Persistent storage using CIFS/SMB CSI Driver Operator is generally available
{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) with a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for the Common Internet File System (CIFS) dialect/Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. The CIFS/SMB CSI Driver Operator that manages this driver was introduced in {product-title} 4.16 with Technology Preview status. In {product-title} 4.18, it is now generally available.

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-smb-cifs.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-smb-cifs[CIFS/SMB CSI Driver Operator].

[id="ocp-4-18-release-notes-storage-secret-csi-driver_{context}"]
==== Secret Store CSI Driver Operator is generally available
The Secrets Store Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator, `secrets-store.csi.k8s.io`, allows {product-title} to mount multiple secrets, keys, and certificates stored in enterprise-grade external secrets stores into pods as an inline ephemeral volume. The Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator communicates with the provider using gRPC to fetch the mount contents from the specified external secrets store. After the volume is attached, the data in it is mounted into the container’s file system. The Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator was available in {product-title} 4.14 as a Technology Preview feature. {product-title} 4.18 introduces this feature as generally available.

For more information about the Secrets Store CSI driver, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-secrets-store.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-secrets-store[Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator].

For information about using the Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator to mount secrets from an external secrets store to a CSI volume, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-secrets-store.adoc[Providing sensitive data to pods by using an external secrets store].

[id="ocp-4-18-release-notes-storage-pv-last-phase-transition-time_{context}"]
==== Persistent volume last phase transition time parameter is generally available
{product-title} 4.16 introduced a new parameter, `LastPhaseTransitionTime`, which has a timestamp that is updated every time a persistent volume (PV) transitions to a different phase (`pv.Status.Phase`). For {product-title} 4.18, this feature is generally available.

For more information about using the persistent volume last phase transition time parameter, see xref:../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#last-phase-transition-time[Last phase transition time].

{product-title} 4.17 introduced the ability to deploy {product-title} across multiple vSphere clusters (vCenters) as a Technology Preview feature. In {product-title} 4.18, Multiple vCenter support is now generally available.

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-vsphere.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-vsphere-multi-vcenter-support-overview_persistent-storage-csi-vsphere[Multiple vCenter support for vSphere CSI] and xref:../installing/installing_vsphere/installation-config-parameters-vsphere.adoc[Installation configuration parameters for vSphere].

[id="ocp-4-18-release-notes-storage-always-honor-reclaim-policy_{context}"]
==== Always honor persistent volume reclaim policy (Technical Preview)
Prior to {product-title} 4.18, the persistent volume (PV) reclaim policy was not always applied.

For a bound PV and persistent volume claim (PVC) pair, the ordering of PV-PVC deletion determined whether the PV delete reclaim policy was applied or not. The PV applied the reclaim policy if the PVC was deleted prior to deleting the PV. However, if the PV was deleted prior to deleting the PVC, then the reclaim policy was not applied. As a result of that behavior, the associated storage asset in the external infrastructure was not removed.

With {product-title} 4.18, the PV reclaim policy is consistently always applied. This feature has Technical Preview status.

For more information, see xref:../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#reclaiming_understanding-persistent-storage[Reclaim policy for persistent volumes].

[id="ocp-4-18-release-notes-storage-lso-cleanup_{context}"]

For more information, see xref:../storage/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_local/persistent-storage-local.adoc#local-removing-device_persistent-storage-local[Removing a local volume or local volume set].

[id="ocp-4-18-release-notes-storage-volume-group-snapshots_{context}"]
==== CSI volume group snapshots (Technology Preview)
{product-title} 4.18 introduces Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume group snapshots as a Technology Preview feature. This feature needs to be supported by the CSI driver. CSI volume group snapshots use a label selector to group multiple persistent volume claims (PVCs) for snapshotting. A volume group snapshot represents copies from multiple volumes that are taken at the same point-in-time. This can be useful for applications that contain multiple volumes.

{rh-storage} supports volume group snapshots.

For more information about CSI volume group snapshots, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-group-snapshots.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-group-snapshots[CSI volume group snapshots].

==== GCP PD CSI driver supports the C3 instance type for bare metal and N4 machine series is generally available
The Google Cloud Platform Persistent Disk (GCP PD) Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver supports the C3 instance type for bare metal and N4 machine series. The C3 instance type and N4 machine series support the hyperdisk-balanced disks.

Additionally, hyperdisk storage pools are supported for large-scale storage. A hyperdisk storage pool is a purchased collection of capacity, throughput, and IOPS, which you can then provision for your applications as needed.

For {product-title} 4.18, this feature is generally available.

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-gcp-pd.adoc#c3-instance-type-for-bare-metal-and-n4-machine-series[C3 instance type for bare metal and N4 machine series].

=== Web console

[id="ocp-4-18-administrator-perspective_{context}"]
==== Administrator perspective

This release introduces the following updates to the *Administrator* perspective of the web console:

* A new setting for hiding the *Getting started resources* card on the *Overview* page allowing for maximum use of the dashboard.
* A *Start Job* option was added to the CronJob *List* and *Details* pages, so you can start individual CronJobs manually directly in the web console without having to use the `oc` CLI.
* The *Import YAML* button in the masthead is now a *Quick Create* button that you can use for the rapid deployment of workloads by imprting from YAML, Git, or using container images.
* You can build your own generative-AI chat bot with a chat bot sample. The generative-AI chat bot sample is deployed with Helm and includes a full CI/CD pipeline. You can also run this sample on your cluster with no CPUs.
* You can import YAML into the console using {ols}.

[id="ocp-4-18-administrator-perspective_content-security-policy{context}"]
===== Content Security Policy (CSP)

With this release, the console Content Security Policy (CSP) is deployed in report-only mode. CSP violations will be logged in the browser console, but the associated CSP directives will not be enforced. Dynamic plugin creators can add their own policies.

Additionally, you can report any plugins that break security policies. Administrators have the ability to disable any plugin breaking those policies. CSP violations will be logged in the browser console, but the associated CSP directives will not be enforced. This feature is behind a `feature-gate`, so you will need to manually enable it.

For more information, see xref:../web_console/dynamic-plugin/content-security-policy.adoc#content-security-policy[Content Security Policy (CSP)]and xref:../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-enabling-features.adoc#nodes-cluster-enabling-features-console_nodes-cluster-enabling[Enabling feature sets using the web console].

[id="ocp-4-18-developer-perspective_{context}"]
==== Developer Perspective

This release introduces the following updates to the *Developer* perspective of the web console:

* Added a {product-title} toolkit, Quarkus tools and JBoss EAP, and a Language Server Protocol Plugin for Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ.
* Previously, when moving from light mode to dark mode in the Monaco editor, the console remained in dark mode. With this update, the Monaco code editor will match the selected theme.

[id="ocp-4-18-rhcos-iscsi-initiator_{context}"]
=== Changes to the iSCSI initiator name and service

Previously, the `/etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi` file was present by default on {op-system} images. With this release, the `initiatorname.iscsi` file is no longer present by default. Instead, it is created at run time when the `iscsi.service` and subsequent `iscsi-init.service` services start. This service is not enabled by default and might affect any CSI drivers that rely on reading the contents of the `initiatorname.iscsi` file prior to starting the service.

[id="ocp-release-note-api-auth-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== API Server and Authentication

* Previously, API validation did not prevent an authorized client from decreasing the current revision of a static pod operand, such as kube-apiserver, or prevent the operand from progressing concurrently on two nodes. With this release, requests that attempt to do either are now rejected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-48502[*OCPBUGS-48502*])

* Previously, the oauth-server would crash when configuring an oath identity provider (IDP) with a callback path that contained spaces. With this release, the issue is resolved.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-44099[*OCPBUGS-44099*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-release-note-bare-metal-hardware-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Bare Metal Hardware Provisioning

* Previously, the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) created the `HostFirmwareComponents` custom resource for all Bare Metal hosts (BMH), including ones based on the intelligent platform management interface (IPMI), which did not support it. With this release, `HostFirmwareComponents` custom resources are only created for BMH that support it. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-49699[*OCPBUGS-49699*])

* Previously, in bare-metal configurations where the provisioning network is disabled but the `bootstrapProvisioningIP` field is set, the bare-metal provisioning components might fail to start. These failures occur when the provisioning process reconfigures the external network interface on the bootstrap VM during the process of pulling container images. With this release, dependencies were added to ensure that interface reconfiguration only occurs when the network is idle, preventing conflicts with other processes. As a result, the bare-metal provisioning components now start reliably, even when the `bootstrapProvisioningIP` field is set and the provisioning network is disabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36869[*OCPBUGS-36869*])

* Previously, Ironic inspection failed if special or invalid characters existed in the serial number of a block device. This occurred because the `lsblk` command failed to escape the characters. With this release, the command now escapes the characters so this issue no longer persists. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36492[*OCPBUGS-36492*])

* Previously, a check for unexpected IP addresses on the provisioning interface during metal3 pod startup was triggered. This issue occured because of the presence of an IP addresses supplied by DHCP from a previous version of the pod that existed on another node. With this release, a pod startup check now looks only for IP addresses that exist outside the provisioning network subnet, so that a metal3 pod starts immediately, even when if the node has moved to a different node.

==== Builds

[discrete]
[id="ocp-release-note-cloud-compute-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Cloud Compute

* Previously, the availability set fault domain count was hardcoded to `2`. This value works in most regions in {azure-full} because the fault domain counts are typically at least `2`, but failed in the `centraluseuap` and `eastusstg` regions. With this release, the availability set fault domain count in a region is set dynamically. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-48659[*OCPBUGS-48659*])

* Previously, an updated zone API error message from {gcp-first} with increased granularity caused the machine controller to mistakenly mark the machine as valid with a temporary cloud error instead of recognizing it as an invalid machine configuration error. This prevented the invalid machine from transitioning to a `failed` state. With this update, the machine controller handles the new error messages correctly, and machines with an invalid zone or project ID now transition properly to a failed state. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-47790[*OCPBUGS-47790*])

* Previously, the certificate signing request (CSR) approver included certificates from other systems within its calculations for whether it was overwhelmed and should stop approving certificates. In larger clusters, with other subsystems using CSRs, the CSR approver counted unrelated unapproved CSRs towards its total and prevented further approvals. With this release, the CSR approver only includes CSRs that it can approve, by using the `signerName` property as a filter. As a result, the CSR approver only prevents new approvals when there are a large number of unapproved CSRs for the relevant `signerName` values. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-46425[*OCPBUGS-46425*])

* Previously, some cluster autoscaler metrics were not initialized, and therefore were not available. With this release, these metrics are initialized and available. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-46416[*OCPBUGS-46416*])

* Previously, if an informer watch stream missed an event because of a temporary disconnection, the informer might return a special signal type after it reconnected to the network, especially when the informer recognizes that an EndpointSlice object was deleted during the temporary disconnection. The returned signal type indicated that the state of the event has stalled and that the object was deleted. The returned signal type was not accurate and might have caused confusion for a {product-title} user. With this release, the Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) handles unexpected signal types  so that {product-title} users do not receive confusing information from returned types. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45972[*OCPBUGS-45972*])

* Previously, when the {aws-short} DHCP option set was configured to use a custom domain name that contains a trailing period (`.`), {product-title} installation failed. With this release, the logic that extracts the hostname of EC2 instances and turns them into Kubelet node names is updated to trim trailing periods so that the resulting Kubernetes object name is valid. Trailing periods in the DHCP option set no longer cause installation to fail. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45889[*OCPBUGS-45889*])

* Previously, installation of an {aws-short} cluster failed in certain environments on existing subnets when the `publicIp` parameter for the `MachineSet` object was explicity set to `false`. With this release, a configuration value set for `publicIp` no longer causes issues when the installation program provisions machines for your {aws-short} cluster in certain environment. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45130[*OCPBUGS-45130*])

* Previously, enabling a provisioning network by editing the cluster-wide Provisioning resource was only possible on clusters with platform type "baremetal", such as ones created by the IPI installer. On baremetal SNO and UPI clusters that would result in a validation error. The excessive validation has been removed, and enabling a provisioning network is now possible on baremetal clusters with platform type "none". As with IPI, users are responsible for making sure that all networking requirements are met for this operation.

* Previously, the installation program populated the `network.devices`, `template` and `workspace` fields in the `spec.template.spec.providerSpec.value` section of the {vmw-full} control plane machine set custom resource (CR). These fields should be set in the {vmw-short} failure domain, and the installation program populating them caused unintended behaviors. Updating these fields did not trigger an update to the control plane machines, and these fields were cleared when the control plane machine set was deleted. With this release, the installation program is updated to no longer populate values that are included in the failure domain configuration.
If these values are not defined in a failure domain configuration, for instance on a cluster that is updated to {product-title} {product-version} from an earlier version, the values defined by the installation program are used. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32947[*OCPBUGS-32947*])

* Previously, the cluster autoscaler would occasionally leave a node with a `PreferNoSchedule` taint during deletion. With this release, the maximum bulk deletion limit is disabled so that nodes with this taint no longer remain after deletion. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42132[*OCPBUGS-42132*])

* Previously, the Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) liveness probe used on {ibm-cloud-title} cluster installations could not use loopback and this caused the probe to continuously restart. With this release, the probe can use loopback so that this issue not longer occurs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41936[*OCPBUGS-41936*])

* Previously, the approval mechanism for certificate signing requests (CSRs) failed because the node name and internal DNS entry for a CSR did not match in terms of character case differences. With this release, an update to the approval mechanism for CSRs skips case-sensitive checks so that a CSR with a matching node name and internal DNS entry does not fail the check because of character case differences. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36871[*OCPBUGS-36871*])

* Previously, the cloud node manager had permission to update any node object when it needed to update only the node on which it was running. With this release, restrictions have been put in place to prevent the node manager from one node updating the node object of another node.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22190[*OCPBUGS-22190*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-release-note-cloud-cred-operator-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Cloud Credential Operator

* Previously, the `aws-sdk-go-v2` software development kit (SDK) failed to authenticate an `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` API operation on an {aws-first} {sts-first} cluster. With this release, `pod-identity-webhook` now includes a default region so that this issue no longer persists. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45937[*OCPBUGS-45937*])

* Previously, secrets in the cluster were fetched in a single call. When there were a large number of secrets, this caused the API to time out. With this release, the Cloud Credential Operator fetches secrets in batches limited to 100 secrets. This change prevents timeouts when there are large number of secrets in the cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39531[*OCPBUGS-39531*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-release-note-cluster-override-admin-operator-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Cluster Resource Override Admission Operator

* Previously, if you specified the `forceSelinuxRelabel` field in a `ClusterResourceOverride` custom resource (CR), and then modified it afterwards, the change would not be reflected in the `clusterresourceoverride-configuration` config map, which is used to apply the SELinux re-labeling workaround feature. With this update, the Cluster Resource Override Operator can track the change to the `forceSelinuxRelabel` feature in order to reconcile the config map object. As a result, the config map object is correctly updated when you change the `ClusterResourceOverride` CR field. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-48692[*OCPBUGS-48692*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-release-note-cluster-version-operator-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Cluster Version Operator

* Previously, a custom security context constraint (SCC) impacted any pod that was generated by the Cluster Version Operator from receiving a cluster version upgrade. With this release, {product-title} now sets a default SCC to each pod, so that any custom SCC created does not impact a pod.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-46410[*OCPBUGS-46410*])

* Previously, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) did not filter internal errors that were propogated to the "ClusterVersion Failing" condition message. As a result, errors that did not negatively impact the update were shown in the "ClusterVersion Failing" condition message. With this release, the errors that are propogated to the "ClusterVersion Failing" condition message are filtered. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15200[*OCPBUGS-15200*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-release-note-dev-console-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Developer Console

* Previously, if a `PipelineRun` was using a resolver, rerunning that `PipelineRun` resulted in an error. With this fix, a user can rerun `PipelineRun` if it is using resolver. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45228[*OCPBUGS-45228*])

* Previously, on the if you edited a deployment config in *Form view*, the `ImagePullSecrets` values were duplicated. With this update, editing the form does not add duplicate entries. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45227[*OCPBUGS-45227*])

* Previously, when you searched on the `OperatorHub` or another catalog, you would experience periods of latency between each key press. With this update, the input on the catalog search bars are debounced. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43799[*OCPBUGS-43799*])

* Previously, no option existed to close the *Getting started resources* section in the *Administrator* perspective. With this change, user can close the *Getting started resources* section. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38860[*OCPBUGS-38860*])

* Previously, when cronjobs were created, the creation of pods happens too quickly, causing the component that fetches new pods off the cronjob to fail. With this update, a 3 second delay was added before starting to fetch the pods of the cronjob. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37584[*OCPBUGS-37584*])

* Previously, resources created when a new user is created were not removed automatically when the user was deleted. This caused clutter on the cluster with configuration maps, roles, and role-bindings. With this update, `ownerRefs` was added to the resources, so they are cleared once the user is deleted and the cluster no longer clutters with users. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37560[*OCPBUGS-37560*])

* Previously, when importing a Git repository using the serverless import strategy, the environment variables from the `func.yaml` were not automatically loaded into the form. With this update, the environment variables are now loaded upon import. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34764[*OCPBUGS-34764*])

* Previously, users would erroneously see an option to import a repository using the pipeline build strategy when the devfile import strategy was selected; however, this was not possible. With this update, the pipeline strategy has been removed when the devfile import strategy is selected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32526[*OCPBUGS-32526*])

* Previously, when using a custom template, you could not enter multi-line parameters, such as private keys. With this release, you can switch between single-line and multi-line modes so you can fill out template fields with multi-line inputs.

==== Image Registry

* Previously, you could not install a cluster on {aws-short} in the `ap-southeast-5` region or other regions because the {product-title} internal registry did not support these regions. With this release, the internal registry is updated to include the following regions so that this issue no longer occurs:
+
** `ap-southeast-5`
** `ap-southeast-7`
** `ca-west-1`
** `il-central-1`
** `mx-central-1`
+
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-49693[*OCPBUGS-49693*])

* Previously, when the Image Registry Operator was configured with `networkAccess: Internal` in {azure-first}, it would not be possible to successfully set `managementState` to `Removed` in the Operator configuration. This occurred because of an authorization error when the Operator tried to delete the storage container. With this update, the Image Registry Operator continues with the deletion of the storage account, which automatically deletes the storage container, resulting in a successful change into the `Removed` state. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42732[*OCPBUGS-42732*])

* Previously, when configuring the image registry to use an {azure-first} storage account located in a resource group other than the cluster's resource group, the Image Registry Operator would become degraded due to a validation error. This update changes the Image Registry Operator to allow for authentication by only storage account key without validating for other authentication requirements. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42514[*OCPBUGS-42514*])

* Previously, installation with the OpenShift installer used the cluster API. Virtual networks created by the cluster API use a different tag template. Consequently, setting `.spec.storage.azure.networkAccess.type: Internal` in the Image Registry Operator's `config.yaml` file resulted in the Image Registry Operator unable to discover the virtual network. With this update, the Image Registry Operator searches for both new and old tag templates, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42196[*OCPBUGS-42196*])

* Previously, the image registry would, in some cases, panic when attempting to purge failed uploads from s3-compatible storage providers. This was caused by the image registry's s3 driver mishandling empty directory paths. With this update, the image registry properly handles empty directory paths, fixing the panic.

==== Machine Config Operator

* Previously, {op-system-base-full} CoreOS templates that were shipped by the  Machine Config Operator (MCO) caused node scaling to fail on {rh-openstack-first}. This issue happened because of an issue with `systemd` and the presence of a legacy boot image from older versions of {product-title}. With this release, a patch fixes the issue with `systemd` and removes the legacy boot image, so that node scaling can continue as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42324[*OCPBUGS-42324*])

* Previously, if you enabled on-cluster layering for your cluster and you attempted to configure kernel arguments in the machine configuration, machine config pools (MCPs) and nodes entered a degraded state. This happened because of a configuration mismatch. With this release, a check for kernel arguments for a cluster with OCL-enabled ensures that the arguments are configured and applied to nodes in the cluster. This update prevents any mismatch that previously occurred between the machine configuration and the node configuration. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34647[*OCPBUGS-34647*])

After this update, clicking the "Don't show again" link correctly navigates to the general *User Preference* tab. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-48106[*OCPBUGS-48106*])

* Previously, multiple external link icons might show in the primary action button of the OperatorHub modal. With this update, only a single external link icon appears. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-47742[*OCPBUGS-47742*])

* Previously, the web console was disabled when the authorization type was set to `None` in the cluster authentication configuration. With this update, the web console no longer disables when the authorization type was set to `None`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-46068[*OCPBUGS-46068*])

* Previously, the *MachineConfig Details* tab displayed an error when one or more `spec.config.storage.file` did not include optional data.  With this update, the error no longer occurs and the *Details* tab renders as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-44049[*OCPBUGS-44049*])

* Previously, an extra name property was passed into resource list page extensions used to list related Operands on the *CSV details* page. As a result, the Operand list was filtered by the cluster service version (CSV) name and often returned an empty list. With this update, Operands are listed as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42796[*OCPBUGS-42796*])

* Previously, the *Sample* tab did not show when creating a new ConfigMap with one or more ConfigMap ConsoleYAMLSamples present on the cluster.  After this update, the *Sample* tab shows with one or more ConfigMap ConsoleYAMLSamples present. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41492[*OCPBUGS-41492*])

* Previously, the *Events* page resource type filter incorrectly reported the number of resources when three or more resources were selected.  With this update, the filter always reports the correct number of resources. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38701[*OCPBUGS-38701*])

* Previously, the version number text in the updates graph on the *Cluster Settings* page appeared as black text on a dark background while viewing the page using Firefox in dark mode.  With this update, the text appears as white text. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37988[*OCPBUGS-37988*])

* Previously, *Alerting* pages did not show resource information in their empty state. With this update, resource information is available on the *Alerting* pages. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36921[*OCPBUGS-36921*])

* Previously, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) CSV annotation contained unexpected JSON, which was successfully parsed, but then threw a runtime error when attempting to use the resulting value. With this update, JSON values from OLM annotations are validated before use, errors are logged, and the console does not fail when unexpected JSON is received in an annotation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35744[*OCPBUGS-35744*])

* Previously, silenced alerts were visible on the *Overview* page of the {product-title} web console. This occurred because the alerts did not include any external labels. With this release, silenced alerts include the external labels so they are filtered out and are not viewable. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31367[*OCPBUGS-31367*])

[id="ocp-release-note-monitoring-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Monitoring

* Previously, if the SMTP `smarthost` or `from` fields under the `emailConfigs` object were not specified at the global or receiver level in the `AlertmanagerConfig` custom resource (CR), Alertmanager would crash because these fields are required. With this release, the Prometheus Operator fails reconciliation if these fields are not specified. Therefore, the Prometheus Operator no longer pushes invalid configurations to Alertmanager, preventing it from crashing. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-48050[*OCPBUGS-48050*])

* Previously, the {cmo-first} did not mark configurations in `cluster-monitoring-config` and `user-workload-monitoring-config` config maps as invalid for unknown (for example,  no longer supported) or duplicated fields. With this release, stricter validation is added that helps identify such errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42671[*OCPBUGS-42671*])

* Previously, it was not possible for a user to query the user workload monitoring Thanos API endpoint with `POST` requests. With this update, a cluster admin can bind a new `pod-metrics-reader` cluster role with a role binding or cluster role binding to allow `POST` queries for a user or service account. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41158[*OCPBUGS-41158*])

* Previously, an invalid config map configuration for core platform monitoring, user workload monitoring, or both caused {cmo-first} to report an `InvalidConfiguration` error. With this release, if only the user workload monitoring configuration is invalid, {cmo-short} reports `UserWorkloadInvalidConfiguration`, making it clear where the issue is located. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33863[*OCPBUGS-33863*])

* Previously, `telemeter-client containers` showed a `TelemeterClientFailures Warnings` message in multiple clusters. With this release, a runbook is added for the `TelemeterClientFailures` alert to explain the cause of the alert triggering and the alert provides resolution steps. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33285[*OCPBUGS-33285*])

* Previously, `AlertmanagerConfig` objects with invalid child routes generated invalid Alertmanager configuration leading to Alertmanager disruption. With this release, Prometheus Operator rejects such `AlertmanagerConfig` objects, and users receive a warning about the invalid child routes in logs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30122[*OCPBUGS-30122*])

* Previously, the `config-reloader` for Prometheus for user-defined projects would fail if unset environment variables were used in the `ServiceMonitor` configuration, which resulted in Prometheus pods failing. With this release, the reloader no longer fails when an unset environment variable is encountered. Instead, unset environment variables are left as they are, while set environment variables are expanded as usual. Any expansion errors, suppressed or otherwise, can be tracked through the `reloader_config_environment_variable_expansion_errors` variable.

[id="ocp-release-note-networking-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Networking

* Previously, enabling encapsulated security payload (ESP) offload hardware when using IPSec on Open vSwitch attached interfaces would break connectivity in your cluster. To resolve this issue, {product-title} by default disables ESP offload hardware on Open vSwitch attached interfaces. This fixes the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42987[*OCPBUGS-42987*])

* Previously, if you deleted the default `sriovOperatorConfig` custom resource (CR), you could not recreate the default `sriovOperatorConfig` CR, because the `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` was not initially deleted. With this release, the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) Network Operator removes validating webhooks when you delete the `sriovOperatorConfig` CR, so that you can create a new `sriovOperatorConfig` CR. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41897[*OCPBUGS-41897*])

* Previously, if you set custom annotations in a custom resource (CR), the SR-IOV Operator would override all the default annotations in the `SriovNetwork` CR. With this release, when you define custom annotations in a CR, the SR-IOV Operator does not override the default annotations. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41352[*OCPBUGS-41352*])

* Previously, bonds that were configured in `active-backup` mode would have IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) offload active even if underlying links did not support ESP offload. This caused IPsec associations to fail. With this release, ESP offload is disabled for bonds so that IPsec associations pass. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39438[*OCPBUGS-39438*])

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator (MCO)'s vSphere `resolve-prepender` script used `systemd` directives that were incompatible with old bootimage versions used in {product-title} 4. With this release, nodes can scale using newer bootimage versions {product-version} 4.13 and above, through manual intervention, or by upgrading to a release that includes this fix. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38012[*OCPBUGS-38012*])

* Previously, the Ingress Controller status incorrectly displayed as `Degraded=False` because of a migration time issue with the `CanaryRepetitiveFailures` condition. With this release, the Ingress Controller status is correctly marked as `Degraded=True` for the appropriate length of time that the `CanaryRepetitiveFailures` condition exists. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37491[*OCPBUGS-37491*])

* Previously, when a pod was running on a node on which egress IPv6 is assigned, the pod was not able to communicate with the Kubernetes service in a dual stack cluster. This resulted in the traffic with the IP family, that the egressIP is not applicable to, being dropped. With this release, only the source network address translation (SNAT) for the IP family that the egress IPs applied to is deleted, eliminating the risk of traffic being dropped. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37193[*OCPBUGS-37193*])

* Previously, the Single-Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) Operator did not expire the acquired lease during the Operator's shutdown operation. This impacted a new instance of the Operator, because the new instance had to wait for the lease to expire before the new instance was operational. With this release, an update to the Operator shutdown logic ensures that the Operator expires the lease when the Operator is shutting down. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23795[*OCPBUGS-23795*])

* The current PTP grandmaster clock (T-GM) implementation has a single National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) sentence generator sourced from the GNSS without a backup NMEA sentence generator. If NMEA sentences are lost before reaching the e810 NIC, the T-GM cannot synchronize the devices in the network synchronization chain and the PTP Operator reports an error. A proposed fix is to report a `FREERUN` event when the NMEA string is lost. Until this limitation is addressed, T-GM does not support PTP clock holdover state. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19838[*OCPBUGS-19838*])

* Previously, for an Ingress resource with an `IngressWithoutClassName` alert, the Ingress Controller did not delete the alert along with deletion of the resource. The alert continued to show on the {product-title} web console. With this release, the Ingress Controller resets the `openshift_ingress_to_route_controller_ingress_without_class_name` metric to `0` before the controller deletes the Ingress resource, so that the alert is deleted and no longer shows on the web console. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-13181[*OCPBUGS-13181*])

* Previously, when either  the `clusterNetwork` or `serviceNetwork` IP address pools overlapped with the default `transit_switch_subnet` `100.88.0.0/16` IP address and the custom value of `transit_switch_subnet` did not take effect, `ovnkube-node` pods crashed after the live migration operation. With this release, the custom value of `transit_switch_subnet` can be passed to `ovnkube node` pods, so that this issue no longer persists. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43740[*OCPBUGS-43740*])

* Previously, a change in OVN-Kubernetes that standardized the `appProtocol` value `h2c` to `kubernetes.io/h2c` was not recognized by OpenShift router. Consequently, specifying `appProtocol: kubernetes.io/h2c` on a service did not cause OpenShift router to use clear-text HTTP/2 to connect to the service endpoints. With this release, OpenShift router was changed to handle `appProtocol: kubernetes.io/h2c` the same way as it handles `appProtocol: h2c` resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42972[*OCPBUGS-42972*])

* Previously, instructions that guided the user after changing the `LoadBalancer` parameter from `External` to `Internal` were missing for {ibm-power-server-title}, {alibaba}, and {rh-openstack-first}. This caused the Ingress Controller to be put in a permanent `Progressing` state. With this release the message `The IngressController scope was changed from Internal to External` is followed by `To effectuate this change, you must delete the service` resolving the permanent `Progressing` state. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39151[*OCPBUGS-39151*])

* Previously, there was no event logged when an error occurred from failed conversion from ingress to route conversion. With this update, this error appear in the event logs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29354[*OCPBUGS-29354*])

* Previously, an `ovnkube-node` pod on a node that uses cgroup v1 was failing because it could not find the kubelet cgroup path. With this release, an `ovnkube-node` pod no longer fails if the node uses cgroup v1. However, the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin outputs an `UDNKubeletProbesNotSupported` event notification. If you enable cgroup v2 for each node, OVN-Kubernetes no longer outputs the event notification.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-50513[*OCPBUGS-50513*])

* Previously, when you finished the live migration for a kubevirt virtual machine (VM) that uses the Layer 2 topology, an old node still transmits IPv4 egress traffic to the virtual machine. With this release, the OVN-Kubernetes plugin updates the gateway MAC address for a  kubevirt virtual machine (VM) during the live migration process so that this issue no longer occurs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-49857[*OCPBUGS-49857*])

* Previously, the DNS-based egress firewall incorrectly prevented creation of a firewall rule that contained a DNS name in uppercase characters. With this release, an fix to the egress firewall no longer prevents creation of a firewall rule that contains a DNS name in uppercase characters. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-49589[*OCPBUGS-49589*])

* Previously, when you attempted to use the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) to upgrade a cluster with existing `localnet` networks, `ovnkube-control-plane` pods failed to run. This happened because the `ovnkube-cluster-manager` container could not process an OVN-Kubernetes `localnet` topology network that did not have subnets defined. With this release, a fix ensures that the `ovnkube-cluster-manager` container can process an OVN-Kubernetes `localnet` topology network that does not have subnets defined. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-44195[*OCPBUGS-44195*])

* Previously, the SR-IOV Network Operator could not retrieve metadata when cloud-native network (CNF) workers were deployed with a configuration drive on {rh-openstack-first}. A configuration drive is often unmounted after a boot operation on immutable systems, so now the Operator dynamically mounts a configuration drive when required. The Operator can now retrieve the metadata and then unmount the configuration drive. This means that you no longer need to manually mount and unmount the configuration drive. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41829[*OCPBUGS-41829*])

* Previously, when you switched your cluster to use a different load balancer, the Ingress Operator did not remove the values from the `classicLoadBalancer` and `networkLoadBalancer` parameters in the `IngressController` custom resource (CR) status. This situation caused the status of the CR to report wrong information from the `classicLoadBalancer` and `networkLoadBalancer` parameters. With this release, after you switch your cluster to use a different load balancer, the Ingress Operator removes values from these parameters so that the CR reports a more accurate and less confusing message status. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38217[*OCPBUGS-38217*])

* Previously, a duplicate feature gate, `ExternalRouteCertificate`, was added to the `FeatureGate` CR. With this release, `ExternalRouteCertificate` is removed because a {product-title} cluster does not use this feature gate. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36479[*OCPBUGS-36479*])

* Previously, after a user created a route, the user needed both `create` and `update` permissions on the `routes/custom-host` sub-resource to edit the `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` field of a route. With this release, this permission requirement has been fixed, so that a user only needs the `create` permission to edit the `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` field of a route. The `update` permission is now marked as an optional permission. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34373[*OCPBUGS-34373*])

==== Node Tuning Operator (NTO)

* Previously, CPU masks for interrupt and network handling CPU affinity were computed incorrectly on machines with more than 256 CPUs. This issue prevented proper CPU isolation and caused `systemd` unit failures during internal node configuration. This fix ensures accurate CPU affinity calculations, enabling correct CPU isolation on machines with more than 256 CPUs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36431[*OCPBUGS-36431*])

* Previously, entering an invalid value in any `cpuset` field under `spec.cpu` in the `PerformanceProfile` resource caused the webhook validation to crash. With this release, improved error handling for the `PerformanceProfile` validation webhook ensures that invalid values for these fields return an informative error.

[id="ocp-release-note-observability-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Observability

* Previously, a namespace was passed to a full cluster query on the alerts graph, and this caused the tenancy API path to be used. The API lacked permissions to retrieve data so no data was shown on the alerts graph. With this release, the namespace is no longer passed to a full cluster query for an alert graph. A non-tenancy API path is now used because this API has the correct permissions to retrieve data. Data is not available on an alert graph. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-46371[*OCPBUGS-46371*])

* Previously, bounds were based on the first bar in a bar chart. If a bar was larger in size than the first bar, the bar would extend beyond the bar chart boundary. With this release, the bound for a bar chart is based on the largest bar, so no bars extend outside the boundary of a bar chart. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-46059[*OCPBUGS-46059*])

* Previously, a {rh-rhacm-first} Alerting UI refactor update caused an `isEmpty` check to go missing on the *Observe -> Metrics* menu. The missing check inverted the behavior of the  *Show all Series* and *Hide all Series* states. This release readds `isEmpty` check so that *Show all Series* is now visible when series are hidden and *Hide all Series* is now visible when the series are shown. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-46047[*OCPBUGS-46047*])

* Previously, on the *Observe -> Alerting -> Silences* tab, the `DateTime` component changed the ordering of an event and its value. Because of this issue, you could not edit the `until` parameter for a silent alert in either the *Developer* or the *Administrator* perspective. With this release, a fix means to the `DateTime` component means that you can now edit the `until` parameter for a silent alert. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-46021[*OCPBUGS-46021*])

* Previously, when using the *Developer* perspective with custom editors, clicking the `n` key caused the *Namespace* menu unexpectedly opened. The issue happened because the keyboard shortcut did not account for custom editors. With this release, the *Namespace* menu accounts for custom editors and does not open if you type 'n' key. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38775[*OCPBUGS-38775*])

* Previously, on on the *Observe -> Alerting -> Silences* tab, the `creator` field was not autopopulated and was not designated as mandatory. This issue happened when the API made the field empty from {product-title} 4.15 and onwards. With this update, the field is marked as mandatory and populated with the current user for correct validation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35048[*OCPBUGS-35048*])

==== Performance Addon Operator

* Previously, the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) failed to build a performance profile for compute nodes that had different core ID numbering (core per socket) for their logical processors and the nodes existed under the same node pool. For example, the PPC failed in a situation for two compute nodes that have logical processors `2` and `18`, where one node groups them as core ID `2` and the other node groups them as core ID `9`.
+
With this release, PPC no longer fails to create the performance profile because PPC can now build a performance profile for a cluster that has compute nodes that each have different core ID numbering for their logical processors. The PPC now outputs a warning message that indicates to use the generated performance profile with caution, because different core ID numbering might impact system optimization and isolated management of tasks. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-44644[*OCPBUGS-44644*])

* Previously, if you specified a long string of isolated CPUs in a performance profile, such as `0,1,2,...,512`, the `tuned`, Machine Config Operator and `rpm-ostree` components failed to process the string as expected. As a consequence, after you applied the performance profile, the expected kernel arguments were missing. The system failed silently with no reported errors. With this release, the string for isolated CPUs in a performance profile is converted to sequential ranges, such as `0-512`. As a result, the kernel arguments are applied as expected in most scenarios. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45264[*OCPBUGS-45264*])

This occurred even when the `kdump` destination was a remote machine that did not need access to the local disk. With this release, the issue is fixed and the `kdump` initramfs successfully opens a local encrypted disk. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43040[*OCPBUGS-43040*])

* Previously, explicitly disabling FIPS mode with `fips=0` caused some systemd services, that assume FIPS mode was requested, to run and consequently fail. This issue resulted in {op-system} failing to boot. With this release, the relevant systemd services now only run if FIPS mode is enabled by specifying `fips=1`. As a result, {op-system} now correctly boots without FIPS mode enabled when `fips=0` is specified. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39536[*OCPBUGS-39536*])

[id="ocp-release-note-scalability-and-performance-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Scalability and performance

* Previously, you could configure the NUMA Resources Operator to map a `nodeGroup` to more than one `MachineConfigPool`. This implementation is contrary to the intended design of the Operator, which assumed a one-to-one mapping between a `nodeGroup` and a `MachineConfigPool`. With this release, if a `nodeGroup` maps to more than one `MachineConfigPool`, the Operator accepts the configuration, but the Operator state moves to `Degraded`. To retain the previous behavior, you can apply the `config.node.openshift-kni.io/multiple-pools-per-tree: enabled` annotation to the NUMA Resources Operator. However, the ability to assign a `nodeGroup` to more than one `MachineConfigPool` will be removed in a future release. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42523[*OCPBUGS-42523*])

[id="ocp-4-18-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues

* The DNF package manager included in {op-system-first} images cannot be used at runtime, because DNF relies on additional packages to access entitled nodes in a cluster that are under a Red Hat subscription. As a workaround, use the `rpm-ostree` command instead. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35247[*OCPBUGS-35247*])

* A regression in the behaviour of `libreswan` caused some nodes with IPsec enabled to lose communication with pods on other nodes in the same cluster. To resolve this issue, consider disabling IPsec for your cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43713[*OCPBUGS-43713*])

* There is a known issue with {op-base-system} 8 worker nodes that  use `cgroupv1` Linux Control Groups (cgroup). The following is an example of the error message displayed for impacted nodes: `UDN are not supported on the node ip-10-0-51-120.us-east-2.compute.internal as it uses cgroup v1.` As a workaround, users should migrate worker nodes from `cgroupv1` to `cgroupv2`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-49933[*OCPBUGS-49933*])

* The current PTP grandmaster clock (T-GM) implementation has a single National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) sentence generator sourced from the GNSS without a backup NMEA sentence generator. If NMEA sentences are lost before reaching the e810 NIC, the T-GM cannot synchronize the devices in the network synchronization chain and the PTP Operator reports an error. A proposed fix is to report a `FREERUN` event when the NMEA string is lost. Until this limitation is addressed, T-GM does not support PTP clock holdover state. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19838[*OCPBUGS-19838*])

* There is a known issue with a Layer 2 network topology on clusters running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). At this time, the egress IP addresses being used in the Layer 2 network that is created by a `UserDefinedNetwork` (UDN) resource are using the wrong source IP address. Consequentially, UDN is not supported on Layer 2 on GCP. Currently, there is no fix for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-48301[*OCPBUGS-48301*])

* There is a known issue with user-defined networks (UDN) that causes OVN-Kubernetes to delete any routing table ID equal or higher to 1000 that it does not manage. Consequently, any Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance created outside OVN-Kubernetes is deleted. This issue impacts users who have created user-defined VRFs with a table ID greater than or equal to 1000. As a workaround, users must change their VRFs to a table ID lower than 1000 as these are reserved for {product-title}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-50855[*OCPBUGS-50855*])

* If you attempted to log in to a {product-title} 4.17 server by using the {oc-first} that you installed as part of the {product-title} {product-version}, you would see the following warning message in your terminal:
+
[source,terminal]
----
Warning: unknown field "metadata"
You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
----
+
This warning message is a known issue but does not indicate any functionality issues with {product-title}. You can safely ignore the warning message and continue to use {product-title} as intended. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-44833[*OCPBUGS-44833*])

* There is a known issue in {product-title} {product-version} which causes the cluster's masquerade subnet to be set to `169.254.169.0/29` if the `ovnkube-node` daemon set is deleted. When the masquerade subnet is set to `169.254.169.0/29`, `UserDefinedNetwork` custom resources (CRs) cannot be created.
+
[NOTE]
====
* If your masquerade subnet has been configured at Day 2 by making changes to the `network.operator` CR, it will not be reverted to `169.254.169.0/29`.
* If a cluster has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.16, the masquerade subnet remains `169.254.169.0/29` for backward compatibility. The masquerade subnet should be changed to a subnet with more IPs, for example, `169.254.0.0/17`, to use the user-defined networks feature.
====
+
This known issue occurs after performing one of the following actions:
+
[cols="2", options="header"]
|===
| Action | Consequence

| You have restarted the `ovnkube-node` `DaemonSet` object.
| The masquerade subnet is set to `169.254.169.0/29`, which does not support `UserDefinedNetwork` CRs.

| You have deleted the `ovnkube-node` `DaemonSet` object.
| The masquerade subnet is set to `169.254.169.0/29`, which does not support `UserDefinedNetwork` CRs. Additionally, `ovnkube-node` pods crash and remain in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state.
|===
+
As a temporary workaround, you can delete the `UserDefinedNetwork` CR and then restart all `ovnkube-node` pods by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pod -l app=ovnkube-node -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes
----
+
The `ovnkube-node` pods automatically restart, which re-stabilizes the cluster. Then, you can set the masquerade subnet to a larger IP address, for example, `169.254.0.0/17` for IPv4. As a result, `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` or `UserDefinedNetwork` CRs can be created.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not delete the `ovnkube-node` `DaemonSet` object when deleting `ovnkube-node` pods. Doing so sets the masquerade subnet to `169.254.169.0/29`.
====
+
For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configure-ovn-kubernetes-subnets.adoc#nw-ovn-k-day-2-masq-subnet_configure-ovn-kubernetes-subnets[Configuring the OVN-Kubernetes masquerade subnet as a Day 2 operation].
+
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-49662[*OCPBUGS-49662*])

* Adding or removing nodes from the cluster can cause ownership contention over the node status. This can cause new nodes to take an extended period of time to appear. As a workaround, you can restart the `kube-apiserver-operator` pod in the `openshift-kube-apiserver-operator` namespace to expedite the process. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-50587[*OCPBUGS-50587*])

* For dual-stack networking clusters that run on {rh-openstack}, when a Virtual IP (VIP) that is attached to a Floating IP (FIP) moves between master nodes, the association between VIP and FIP might stop working if the new master is on a different compute node. This issue occurs because OVN assumes that both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on a shared Neutron port belong to the same node. (link:https://issues.redhat.com//browse/OCPBUGS-50599[*OCPBUGS-50599*])

[id="ocp-telco-ran-4-18-known-issues_{context}"]

* When you run Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) latency tests on an {product-title} cluster, the test can sometimes return results greater than the latency threshold for the test; for example, 20 microseconds for `cyclictest` testing. This results in a test failure.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42328[*OCPBUGS-42328*])

* There is a known issue when the grandmaster clock (T-GM) transitions to the `Locked` state too soon. This happens before the Digital Phase-Locked Loop (DPLL) completes its transition to the `Locked-HO-Acquired` state, and after the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) time source is restored.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-49826[*OCPBUGS-49826*])

[id="ocp-telco-core-4-18-known-issues_{context}"]

* Due to an issue with Kubernetes, the CPU Manager is unable to return CPU resources from the last pod admitted to a node to the pool of available CPU resources. These resources are allocatable if a subsequent pod is admitted to the node. However, this pod then becomes the last pod, and again, the CPU manager cannot return this pod's resources to the available pool.
+
This issue affects CPU load-balancing features, which depend on the CPU Manager releasing CPUs to the available pool. Consequently, non-guaranteed pods might run with a reduced number of CPUs. As a workaround, schedule a pod with a `best-effort` CPU Manager policy on the affected node. This pod will be the last admitted pod and this ensures the resources will be correctly released to the available pool. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-46428[*OCPBUGS-46428*])

* When a pod uses the CNI plugin for DHCP address assignment in conjunction with other CNI plugins, the network interface for the pod might be unexpectedly deleted. As a result, when the DHCP lease for the pod expires, the DHCP proxy enters a loop when trying to re-create a new lease, leading to the node becoming unresponsive. There is currently no workaround. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45272[*OCPBUGS-45272*])

[id="ocp-nodes-4-18-known-issues_{context}"]

* When using PXE boot to xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-adding-node-iso.adoc#adding-node-iso[add a worker node to an on-premise cluster], sometimes the host fails to reboot from the disk properly, preventing the installation from completing.
As a workaround, you must manually reboot the failed host from the disk. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45116[*OCPBUGS-45116*])

[id="ocp-storage-core-4-18-known-issues_{context}"]

* The GCP PD CSI driver does not support hyperdisk-balanced volumes with RWX mode. Attempting to provision hyperdisk-balanced volumes with RWX mode using the GCP PD CSI driver produces errors and does not mount the volumes with the desired access mode. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-44769[*OCPBUGS-44769*])

* Currently, a GCP PD cluster with c3-standard-2, c3-standard-4, n4-standard-2, and n4-standard-4 nodes can erroneously exceed the maximum attachable disk number, which should be 16. This issue may prevent you from successfully creating or attaching volumes to your pods. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39258[*OCPBUGS-39258*])
